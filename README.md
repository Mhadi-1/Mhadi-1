# About Me

I am a self-taught programmer, starting my career with **Pascal ABC**. During this time, I solved numerous problems and created graphical projects using ABC. Later, I transitioned to **C++** provides me with a comprehensive understanding of memory management without the need to specify data types.

### Key Skills and Projects

- **Memory Management**: Worked with pointers and explored various memory management concepts.
- **Data Structures**: Solved many problems related to strings, arrays, and vectors. Created my own library and learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- **Projects**: 
    - Console applications (e.g., banking system with file handling)
    - Mathematical games
    - Tic-Tac-Toe game
    - Custom dynamic array structure
    - Stack and queue implementations
    - Various projects using linked lists and other data structures such as maps and unions.
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Studied time complexity (Big O notation) and applied this knowledge to solve real-world problems 
Currently, I am mastering the
**.NET Framework**. 
components:
- CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
  - CTS (Common Type System)
  - JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation)
  - CLS (Common Language Specification)
- BCL (Base Class Library)
- .NET Standard Library
