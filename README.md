# About Me

Hello! My name is Mhadi, and I'm from Sudan,I graduated in 2024.

## Programming Journey

I am a self-taught programmer, starting my career with **Pascal ABC**. During this time, I solved numerous problems and created graphical projects using ABC. Later, I transitioned to **C++**, which is a compiled language and fundamental for all programmers. C++ provides me with a comprehensive understanding of memory management without the need to specify data types.

### Key Skills and Projects

- **Memory Management**: Worked with pointers and explored various memory management concepts.
- **Data Structures**: Solved many problems related to strings, arrays, and vectors. Created my own library and learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- **Projects**: 
    - Console applications (e.g., banking system with file handling)
    - Mathematical games
    - Tic-Tac-Toe game
    - Custom dynamic array structure
    - Stack and queue implementations
    - Various projects using linked lists and other data structures such as maps and unions.

- **Algorithm Analysis**: Studied time complexity (Big O notation) and applied this knowledge to solve real-world problems.

### Networking Knowledge

I have over a year of experience studying C++ and possess solid knowledge in networking technologies:
- HTTP
- IP
- Servers, etc.

Currently, I am mastering the **.NET Framework**. I have learned its architecture and core components:
- CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
- CLR (Common Language Runtime)
  - CTS (Common Type System)
  - JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation)
  - CLS (Common Language Specification)
- BCL (Base Class Library)
- .NET Standard Library

I spent only 3 days learning **C#** because the syntax between programming languages is similar, making it easier for someone with a solid foundation.

## GUI Projects

I started with real GUI projects and have created around 6 projects with clean code. However, I recognize that there is still much to learn, such as:
- **SQL**: Crucial for all applications.
- **SOLID Principles**
- **REST API**: For connecting applications.
- **Design Patterns**
- **Soft Skills**

Having lived in Russia for 6 years, I feel ready to work in this field. I understand that working on real projects is serious business and not easy. I hope to get such an opportunity!

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey!
