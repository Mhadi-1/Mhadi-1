<h1>About</h1>

I began my programming journey with a comprehensive roadmap on ProgrammingAdvices.com, where I completed 20 courses. These courses established a solid foundation in essential topics such as algorithms, problem-solving, object-oriented programming (OOP), and core computer science concepts like data structures.

I started with C++, focusing on algorithms and OOP, and then specialized in C#. Additionally, I am currently learning SQL for database management and gaining experience with WinForms, which helped me understand key concepts in creating user interfaces. Throughout my studies, I have worked on various projects, applying my knowledge in practical settings.

I am committed to developing my skills as a full-stack developer. My focus is on mastering both front-end and back-end technologies, enhancing my expertise in web development frameworks, and staying updated with the latest advancements in technology. I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly, and innovative solutions.
